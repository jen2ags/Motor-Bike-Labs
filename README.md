## Purpose
As a motorcycle enthusiast, I want an ecommerce website that allows me to search for my future ride, so I can navigate purchase options. On application, the user will be able to sign up to create an acount and then login to Motor Bike Labs. When the user logs in, they are able to see all of the used motorcycles available. They can browse through these motorcycles and can select a motorcycle to view more information on that particular motorcycle. When logged in, the user will also be able to leave a review about any of the motorcycles available.
